Building neural networks and data processing tools with the help of TensorFlow 2.0, part2

Topics have been covered so far:

* basics of TensorFlow (NumPy, Pandas, Keras)
* implementation of Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on 
  MNIST dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).
* implementation of RNN for time series forecasting

Installation
=============

Create new conda environment and make it active:

```
c:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe env create -f .\scripts\test-tf-2.yml

c:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe env list

c:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate test-tf-2
```

Install additional requirements into active environment:

```
(test-tf-2) pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Overview
=========

Jupyter notebook was added for experiments and as a PoC, but the whole code is written in Python
